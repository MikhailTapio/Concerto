### Please read [License](LICENSE) first.

A Fabric-based (Currently) music player for Minecraft.
It supports local files, online musics, and the most important: NeteaseCloud Music.
QQ Music haven't been fully supported due to technical issues.

More music platforms and more features will be supported in the future.

### Q & A
- Q: Why some musics from NeteaseCloud stop playing at 00:30?
- -- A: You don't have the privilege of NeteaseCloud VIP, or the musics require extra payments.
- Q: How to play audios of Bilibili?
- -- A: Download ffmpeg.exe and put it into root folder of Minecraft. (Certain skills required)
